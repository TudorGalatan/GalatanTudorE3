Design a C++ class (following the previous problem) that reflects the properties of a student.

The class should include the following:
	- methods to set and get the name of the student
	- methods to set and get the grade for mathematics (a grade must be a float value from 1 to 10)
	- methods to set and get the grade for English (a grade must be a float value from 1 to 10)
	- methods to set and get the grade for History (a grade must be a float value from 1 to 10)
	- a method that retrieves the average grade
	- 5 global functions that compares two students in terms of name, grades, average. If two students
	  are equal the return value of such a function will be 0. If the first student is bigger than the second one, the return value will be 1, otherwise -1.

Make sure that you have the following:
	- a header file for the class
	- a cpp file for the methods specific to the class
	- a header file for the global functions
	- a cpp file for the global functions implementation
	- a main.cpp file that shows how the methods and global functions can be used.
