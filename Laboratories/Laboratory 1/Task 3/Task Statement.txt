Read a sentence from the input using scanf API. Then sort split it into words and write
to the screen (using the printf API) the words sorted (from the longest one to the
shortest one). If two words have the same length, they will be sorted out alphabetically.
We consider that each word is separated from another one using space (one or multiple).

I went to the library yesterday

The program will print the following on the screen:
yesterday
library
went
the
to
I
