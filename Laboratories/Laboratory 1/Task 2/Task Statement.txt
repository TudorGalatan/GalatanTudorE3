Write a program in the C language that open the file "in.txt" and prints the sum of the numbers that are
found on each line of the file "in.txt". To open the file use fopen API. Write your own function that
converts a string to a number (similar cu atoi API). To print something on the screen, use the printf
API.

Extra task: Make the program work also for negative numbers.

Example: let's consider the following "ini.txt" file:
123
198698
5009
983279

The program will print on the screen:
1187109
